2. Next we define a model: ``User``, which has 3 fields:``name``, ``email`` and ``id`` (*Note:id is the default primary key*)

3. Then, we create an instance of ``User``.

Common Issues
-------------

1. I meet problem installing MySQL-python via pip.

  for ubuntu users::

      apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

  for mac users,run this command in your terminal::

      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin

2. Primarykey should be generated by MySQL(Such as autoincement priamarykey integer).
